      <Subtitle>1. Description of Service</Subtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        torseek is a search engine and index that aggregates torrent search
        results from multiple private torrent trackers. We do not host, store,
        or distribute any torrent files, content, or copyrighted material. Our
        Service acts solely as an aggregator, providing links to search results
        from third-party trackers. Access to these trackers may require
        membership or invitations, which torseek does not provide or
        facilitate.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        We do not control the content, availability, or accuracy of the results
        from these third-party trackers. Users are responsible for ensuring they
        have legitimate access to any private trackers and for complying with
        those trackers' rules and applicable laws.
      </Paragraph>
